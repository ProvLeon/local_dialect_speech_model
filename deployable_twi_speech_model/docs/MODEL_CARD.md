# TwiSpeechIntentClassifier

## Model Description

Advanced Twi speech intent recognition model trained on local dialect data

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Author:** Local Dialect Speech Team
**License:** MIT
**Tags:** speech-recognition, twi, intent-classification, local-dialect, africa

## Model Details

- **Model Type:** intent_only
- **Architecture:** Neural network with CNN + LSTM/GRU + Attention
- **Input Features:** 39 dimensional audio features
- **Number of Classes:** 49
- **Hidden Dimensions:** 128

## Intended Use

This model is designed for intent recognition in Twi speech. It can classify spoken utterances into predefined intent categories.

### Primary Use Cases
- Voice assistants for Twi speakers
- Intent classification in conversational AI
- Speech analytics for customer service

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases
- General speech recognition (transcription)
- Speaker identification
- Emotion recognition

## Training Data

The model was trained on Twi speech data with intent labels. The training process included:
- Data augmentation for class balance
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

## Performance

- **Architecture:** {'has_conv_layers': True, 'has_lstm': True, 'has_gru': False, 'has_attention': True, 'has_squeeze_excite': False}
- **Training Info:** {}

## Usage

```python
from model_package import SpeechModelPackage

# Load the model
model = SpeechModelPackage.from_pretrained("path/to/this/package")

# Make predictions
intent, confidence = model.predict("path/to/audio.wav")
print(f"Intent: {intent}, Confidence: {confidence:.3f}")
```

## Limitations and Biases

- The model is specifically trained for Twi language
- Performance may vary with different accents or speaking styles
- Limited to predefined intent categories

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure consent when processing speech data
- Be aware of potential biases in training data
- Use responsibly in production systems
